## Overview
 
Hotel-Palace is a comprehensive hotel-management program designed to facilitate and manage the operation of a chain of hotel branches. The program serves multiple purposes, both for hotel personnel and visitors, to enhance the overall experience of booking rooms at a variety of hotels across North America. The purpose of the application is to stand as a tool that benefits both corporations and guests by serving as a central hub for ultimate and efficient service.
 
 
## Problem & Appetite
 
Currently, the staff/employee component of the program is fairly limited. The daily responsibility of supervising hotel obligations is time-consuming, so we are actively considering hiring more people. The problem is that we are manually onboarding employees using PostgreSQL. As a result, workflow is difficult to maintain as we have to close the application to add employees leading to the application being turned off as well as losing potential guests because of this.
 
The goal is to make employee onboarding more efficient. Allowing an existing employee to go through a form sheet that will ask for the new employee's details, results in the new employee being added to the database.
 
Given the circumstances, we are constrained by the time limits of the course, thus we would need to develop the idea by the end of a 6-week period. Ideally, with little interruption, it would take us no more than 6 weeks to implement our idea.

##### High-level description of feature.

This new feature for the hotel management website will allow existing employees to register new oncoming hires. After logging, the existing employee will select the 'Add Employee' option in the dashboard to begin the hiring registeration. The registration consists of submitting employees information (i.e. role, name, DOB).
