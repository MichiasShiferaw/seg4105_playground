### Challenges:

- Coordinating the frontend and backend development to ensure seamless integration.
- Meeting user interface design and user experience expectations.


### Next Steps:
- Begin the creation of the basic layout for the React application.
- Design the user interface for the hotel room filter function.
- Collaborate closely with the backend team to ensure smooth data retrieval and display.





### Blockers:
As of now, I don't have any significant blockers, but I will be monitoring the progress of the UI and ensure it aligns with the backend, making sure data retrieval and display are in sync.

### Short-Term Goals:

By the end of tomorrow, aim to complete the initial layout of the filter component.
