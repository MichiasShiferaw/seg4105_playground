# Shape-Up Chapter-13: Show Progress 

## Introduction

This writing piece will describe and summarise 'the showing progress’ portion of the Shape Up approach, as a continuation of weeks 2, 4, and 7. As a refresher, the betting stage in Chapters 7-9 of 'Shape Up - Stop Running in Circles and Ship Work that Matters consisted of key personnel come together to evaluate and select the best action plan for the preceding cycle. Now, in Chapter 13, the book illustrates how to effectively offer clear status updates.


Nagging for updates is something both managers and developers dislike, in response, this chapter intends to provide guidance in eradicating that ‘*awkward updating feeling*’. The chapter suggests using a hill chart that is updated regularly which will allow all project participants to gauge and compare their progress. The hill chart symbolizes the workload encountered. The first half of the slope, the uphill phase, is about determining what to do (unknown). The beginning half is used to address any ‘I don't know’ moments as they can accumulate and gain more risk if not attended to. During the second half, tasks are well-defined (known), and the end result is foreseeable.

Shape-Up founders cleverly compare the hill chart approach to hosting a dinner party. Weeks ahead of the date, the host hasn’t thought about what to cook. The host will then decide who to invite and account for any food restrictions (e.g. vegetarian). By the eve of the dinner party, the host will have bought all the ingredients, and have more confidence in their progress. 




In essence, a hill chart is an intuitive and digestible method of progress tracking that will assist developers in eliminating doubts and providing management with a glimpse of the progress.
