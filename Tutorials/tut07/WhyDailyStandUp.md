## Introduction
This week, the class completed the betting procedure and is now beginning the 6-week development tenure. Consequently, this writing piece will describe and summarise the 'daily stand up' element of the Scrum Guide’s The Definitive Guide to Scrum: The Rule of the Game. 

## Purpose
Daily stand-ups, also known as daily scrum meetings are typically short (15 mins) meetings that take place at the same time and place every day. The term ‘stand-up meeting’ emphasises that if attendees stand, the meeting should be high-energy and brief. This improves communication, encourages speedy decision-making, broadens the team’s expertise, and, as a result, reduces the need for another meeting. 

## Essence


### Roles
Within the scrum meetings, there are two main characters; stand-up master, and developers. A stand-up master is someone who is not necessarily involved in the development progress but is present to ensure that the meeting takes place. The stand-up is led by developers, who can be played by anyone, including the CTO, CEO, managers, seniors, and juniors. Developers can focus on whatever they choose as long as it progresses towards the stand-up goals. 

### Meeting Structure
During the stand-up meeting, everyone will take turns discussing what they’ve accomplished, what they hope to accomplish, and if they are facing any roadblocks. 

## Conclusion
The Daily Scrum is fairly useful and serves several purposes in the software management domain.
