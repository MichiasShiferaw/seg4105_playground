 ![Stand-up](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.scrum.org/web/The-Daily-Scrum-2.0.jpg)


##Introduction
This week, the class has recently completed the betting process and are currently starting the 6-week tenure of development. Consequently, this writing piece will describe and summarise the 'daily stand up' element of the Scrum Guide’s The Definitive Guide to Scrum: The Rule of the game. 

##Origin
Daily stand up or alternatively referred to as daily scrum meetings are typically quick (15 mins) meetings that occur at the same time and place every day. The origin of the term-up of stand-up meeting suggests that if participants stand, the meeting should be kept high energy and short. 

##Essence
Within the meeting, we are too main characters; Stand up master, and developers. Stand master is someone who isn't necessarily a part of the progress of the application but is there to ensure that the meeting happens. Developers, who can be portrayed by anyone, including CTO, CEO, managers, senior, and junior are responsible for conducting the stand up. Developers can focus on what they choose to focus on as long as it progresses towards the stand-up goals. 
During the actual standup, everyone will take turns in discussing what they’ve accomplished, what they hope to accomplish, and if they are facing any blockage in their progress. Doing so, helps in improving communication, promotes quick decision-making, and consequently eliminate the need for other meeting.





# Show Progress (Chapter 13)



## Introduction
This writing piece will describe and summarise 'the showing progress’ element of the Shape Up process, as a continuation to week 2's, week 4’s and week 7’s instruction. As a refresher, the betting stage is cleverly parallelized to gambling environments in Chapters 7-9 of 'Shape Up - Stop Running in Circles and Ship Work that Matters, where key personnel come together to evaluate and select the best plan of action for the preceding cycle. Now chapter 13, the book illustrates how to effectively provide clear status updates.

## Content
Nagging for updates is something both parties don’t enjoy, in combat to that, this chapter hopes to provide guidances in removing that ‘awakward feeling’. Simply using a hill chart that is updated regularly, will help all participants gage and compare the progress in a project. The hill chart symobolizes the workload encountered. The book synomzes work like a hill, where the beginning half is about figuring out what to do(unknown), and the later is getting it done(known). The book cleverally parallelizes to hosting a dinner party, where the date is a couple weeks ahead and you havn’t thought about what to cook.Now, think of who is attending, any dietary restrictions (vegatarian).By the time you are almost one day out, you will have bought the ingredients and have more confidence in your progress and see the end. 
Also don’t be afraid to address any ‘I dont know’ moments as they can accumulate and gain more risk.
